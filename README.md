# Feed-Reader-Testing From Udacity

In this project I'm using Jasmine testing library to test a sertain functions. 
In the test you will see how to write the suites and specs and how to perfome asynchronous code as well.

To run the test, just clone the repository or download the zip file and open the html file in your browser. 
In this project I used
* HTML5,
* Object-oriented JS.
