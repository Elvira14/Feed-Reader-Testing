# Feed-Reader-Testing From Udacity

In this project I'm using Jasmine testing library to test a sertain functions. 
In this test you will see how to write the suites and specs and how to perfome asynchronous code as well.

To run the test, just clone the repository or download the zip file and in your browser open the html file.

In this project I used
* HTML5,
* Object-oriented JS.
